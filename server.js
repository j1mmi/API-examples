// Here's the heart of the code - a couple of things:
// - Requests for information (like this API performs) are known as GET requests - hence "app.get".  
// Other commonly used request types are POST, PUT and DELETE.  These are HTML protocols, I'll leave you to google this. 
// - The '/cat/:code' is the path we are looking for - ":code" is any text that is entered after cat in the URL.  This text is accessed using "req.params.code".  
// e,g, if the path '/cat/clemFandango' was specified, then calling "req.params.code" would return clemFandango.  
// - The information requested by the user (e.g. the URL path) is stored in the variable res, and the expected response should be supplied in the variable res. 
app.get('/cat/:code', (req,res) => {
  // get the path text specified after cat (e.g. 200)
  var text_in = req.params.code;
  // Compare this value with the http codes specified above. 
  var httpCodeIndex = Object.keys(httpCodes).indexOf(text_in)
  // If the value specified by the user can't be found in the list then -1 will be returned.  In this case we assume that the user dun fucked up, put some error 
  // text together and assign it to the variable "data". 
  if (httpCodeIndex == -1) {
    var data = {
      response_type: 'FAILURE',
      description: 'INVALID INPUT',
      attachments:[{
        image_url: 'https://http.cat/400.jpg'
      }]
    };
  // If the value specified by the user IS found in the list then we assemble a success response and assign it to the variable "data".
  } else {
    var text_out = text_in + ": " + httpCodes[text_in];
    var data = {

      attachments:[{
        image_url: 'https://http.cat/' + text_in + '.jpg'
      }]
    };
  }
  // Finally, we add the JSON (the error or success text object - google "JSON", it's a useful thing to understand) to the response variable res.  This then gets
  // sent back to the user as the response. 
  res.json(data);
});
